<h1>Bubble map</h1>
<hr />
<p>The go-to graphic in this kind of situation is probably the <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/bubblemap.html">bubble map</a>. Basically, one circle is drawn per provided geographic position. The size of the bubble is proportional to its corresponding numeric value. Warning, remember that the bubble area must be proportional to the value, <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/radius_or_area.html">not its radius</a>.</p>
