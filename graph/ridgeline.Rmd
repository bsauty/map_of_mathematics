# Definition {#definition}
***

A Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) shows the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using [histograms](http://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/histogram.html) or [density plots](http://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/density.html), all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap. 


<br>

Here is an example showing how people [perceive probability](http://www.data-to-viz.com/story/OneNumOneCatSeveralObs.html). On the [/r/samplesize](https://www.reddit.com/r/SampleSize/) thread of reddit, questions like *What probability would you assign to the phrase “Highly likely”* were asked. Answers between 0 and 100 were recorded, and here is the distribution for each question:


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=6, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)

# Load dataset from github
data <- read.table("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zonination/perceptions/master/probly.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
data <- data %>% 
  gather(key="text", value="value") %>%
  mutate(text = gsub("\\.", " ",text)) %>%
  mutate(value = round(as.numeric(value),0)) %>%
  filter(text %in% c("Almost Certainly","Very Good Chance","We Believe","Likely","About Even", "Little Chance", "Chances Are Slight", "Almost No Chance"))

library(ggridges)

data %>%
  mutate(text = fct_reorder(text, value)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(y=text, x=value,  fill=text)) +
    geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.6, bandwidth=4) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)
    ) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Assigned Probability (%)")
```


**Disclaimer**: This idea originally comes from a publication of the [CIA](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/art15.html) which resulted in this [figure](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis/fig18.gif/image.gif). Then, [Zoni Nation](https://github.com/zonination) cleaned the reddit dataset and built [graphics with R](https://github.com/zonination/perceptions).  


# What for
***

- Ridgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is `medium to high`, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than ~6 groups, dealing with other [distribution plots](http://www.data-to-viz.com/#portfolio) is probably better.

- It works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.



# Variation
***

- The above example is a ridgeline plot using a set of density plots. It is possible to use histograms as well:
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
data %>%
  mutate(text = fct_reorder(text, value)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(y=text, x=value,  fill=text)) +
    geom_density_ridges(alpha=0.6, stat="binline", bins=20) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)
    ) +
    xlab("") +
    ylab("Assigned Probability (%)")
```


- It is possible to color depending on the numeric variable instead of the categoric one. (code from the [ridgeline R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) by [Claus O. Wilke](https://github.com/clauswilke) )
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.height=5, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(lincoln_weather, aes(x = `Mean Temperature [F]`, y = `Month`, fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "Temp. [F]", option = "C") +
  labs(title = 'Temperatures in Lincoln NE in 2016') +
  theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      panel.spacing = unit(0.1, "lines"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8)
    ) 
```

# Common mistakes {#mistake}
***

- As with histogram or density plot, [play with bin size / bandwidth argument](http://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/bin_size.html).
- Think about [ordering groups](http://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/order_data.html) in a smart way.
- Ridgeline plot works well when there is a `clear pattern` to discover since it hides a part of the data where the overlap takes place.
