<hr />
<p>A <code>stacked area chart</code> is the extension of a basic <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/area.html">area chart</a>. It displays the evolution of the value of several groups on the same graphic. The values of each group are displayed on top of each other, what allows to check on the same figure the evolution of both the total of a numeric variable, and the importance of each group.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The following example shows the evolution of baby name frequencies in the US between 1880 and 2015.</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: This graphic does not have a legend since it is interactive. Hover a group to get its name.

<h1 id="what-for">What for</h1>
<hr />
<p>The efficiency of stacked area graph is <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/stacking.html">discussed</a> and it must be used with care. To put it in a nutshell:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>stacked area graph are <code>appropriate</code> to study the evolution of the <code>whole</code> and the <code>relative proportions</code> of each group. Indeed, the top of the areas allows to visualize how the whole behaves, like for a classic area chart.</p></li>
<li><p>however they are not appropriate to study the evolution of each <code>individual group</code>: it is very hard to substract the height of other groups at each time point. For a more accurate but less attractive figure, consider a <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/line.html">line chart</a> or <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/area.html">area chart</a> using small multiple.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This website dedicates a whole <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/stacking.html">page about stacking</a> and its potential pitfalls, <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveat/stacking.html">visit it</a> to go further.</p>
<h1 id="variation">Variation</h1>
<hr />
<p>A variation of the stacked area graph is the <code>percent stacked area graph</code>. It is the same thing but value of each group are normalized at each time stamp. That allows to study the percentage of each group in the whole more efficiently:</p>

<li>The group order (from bottom to top) can have an influence, try several orders.</li>
