TODO

Before February 15th

- [ ] Find a coherent hierarchy for nodes in the tree, based on depth -> css file
- [ ] Trim the garbage files and clean the ingnominous html hardcoded exports in index.html
- [ ] Find a suitable presentation for both the modal page and the full page
- [ ] Find a way to export md files into html -> python script ?

Later 
- [ ] Fill the tree.js for each domain to get the diagramm right
- [ ] Fill the modal page for each node
- [ ] Fill the full page for each node
- [ ] Find nice visuals for the nodes of the tree -> probably very hard to do but high gain in terms of interface
