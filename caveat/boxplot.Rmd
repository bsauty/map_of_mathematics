A boxplot gives a nice summary of one or more numeric variables. A boxplot is composed of several elements:

- The line that divides the box into 2 parts represents the [median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the data. If the median is 10, it means that there are the same number of data points below and above 10.
- The ends of the box shows the upper (Q3) and lower (Q1) [quartiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile). If the third quartile is 15, it means that 75% of the observation are lower than 15.
- The difference between Quartiles 1 and 3 is called the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range) (IQR)
- The extreme line shows Q3+1.5xIQR to Q1-1.5xIQR (the highest and lowest value excluding outliers).
- Dots (or other markers) beyond the extreme line shows potntial outliers.

A boxplot can summarize the distribution of a numeric variable for several groups. The problem is that summarizing also means losing information, and that can be a pitfall. If we consider the boxplot below, it is easy to conclude that group `C` has a higher value than the others. However, we cannot see the underlying distribution of dots in each group or their number of observations.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)
library(plotly)

# create a dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name=c( rep("A",500), rep("B",500), rep("B",500), rep("C",20), rep('D', 100)  ),
  value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) )
)

# Plot
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=11)
    ) +
    ggtitle("A somewhat misleading boxplot") +
    xlab("")
```

Letâ€™s see what happens when the boxplot is improved using additional elements.



#Adding jitter {#boxplotjitter}
***

If the amount of data you are working with is not too large, adding `jitter` on top of your boxplot can make the graphic more insightful.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10}
# Plot
data %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    geom_jitter(color="grey", size=0.7, alpha=0.5) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=11)
    ) +
    ggtitle("A boxplot with jitter") +
    xlab("")
```

Here some new patterns appear clearly. Group `C` has a small sample size compared to the other groups. This is definitely something you want to find out before saying that group `C` has a higher value than the others. Moreover, it looks like group `B` has a `bimodal distribution`: dots are distributed in 2 groups: around y=18 and y=13.



#Switching to violin plot
***
If you have a large sample size, using `jitter` is not an option anymore since dots will overlap, making the figure uninterpretable. A alternative is the [violin plot](https://www.data-to-viz.com/violin.html), which describes the distribution of the data for each group:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.width=10}
# sample size
sample_size = data %>% group_by(name) %>% summarize(num=n())

# Plot
data %>%
  left_join(sample_size) %>%
  mutate(myaxis = paste0(name, "\n", "n=", num)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=myaxis, y=value, fill=name)) +
    geom_violin(width=1.4) +
    geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color="grey", alpha=0.2) +
    scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    theme_ipsum() +
    theme(
      legend.position="none",
      plot.title = element_text(size=11)
    ) +
    ggtitle("A boxplot with jitter") +
    xlab("")
```
Here it is very clear that the groups have different distributions. The bimodal distribution of group `B` becomes obvious. Violin plots are a powerful way to display information--they are probably under-utilized compared to boxplots.




#Adding the sample size
***
On the previous chart, the sample size of each group is indicated on the x-axis, below the group name. This is a good practice and shows that group `C` is under-represented. However, it is sometimes better to show the data points themselves. Thus, a good alternative is a half violin plot showing the raw data. This uses code coming from [jbburant](https://gist.github.com/jbburant/b3bd4961f3f5b03aeb542ed33a8fe062) and [David Robinson](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/eb7750e74997891d7c20#file-geom_flat_violin-r).
